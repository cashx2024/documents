6. Loan Services
6.1. Loan Amount
CashXpress offers loans ranging from N3,000 (three thousand Naira) to a maximum of N300,000 (Three Hundred Thousand Naira) with interest rates between 2.0% and 4%. The specific loan amount you qualify for is determined by our system evaluating your scoring rates and credit history. The approval of the requested loan amount is not guaranteed if it does not meet our highest-level requirements. However, as your scoring rates and credit history improve, there is a possibility of accessing an increased loan amount. For first-time applicants, the initial loan amount may be lower than the maximum loan offers, but you can select a loan term according to your preferences.

6.2. Loan Approval
Once the loan is approved, You will be provided with a customised Loan Agreement/Letter containing the repayment schedule, loan amount and interest; afterwards, the funds will be transferred to Your bank account, provided to us. The repayment schedule in your loan agreement may be subject to change based on the date and time Your Loan request is fulfilled and disbursed to your account as provided to us. The updated repayment schedule will be reflected in Your Account on the Platform dashboard.

6.3. Loan Repayment
As a Borrower, You agree to repay the loan amount (including both the principal and accrued interest) in accordance with the terms and conditions and in line with your repayment schedule to the CashXpress bank account provided to You or through any payment options provided by CashXpress in Your Loan Agreement or available on Your Account. Loan repayment may be made through the following channels, including:

Bank Transfer
USSD Transfer
Cash Payment
Card Payment through ATM/POS
Alternative Third-party Service Payment Providers
Automated Direct Debits where you bind your card and authorise direct debits through Your credit/debit card issued by Your Bank;
Additionally, if necessary, a direct debit from your account can be arranged if in default of a loan.
The Borrower is responsible for ensuring timely repayment of Loans on or before the Loan Maturity Date. You assume overall responsibility for payment, even in the event of direct debit absence, technical issues with the client’s bank, or hindrances such as direct debit/app/web link failures that prevent payment.

6.4. Earlier payment by you
You have the right to pay off some or all of the debt that you owe us before the due date (early payment). If you pay the outstanding balance under this Agreement before the date the final payment falls due, this will enhance your credit score with us which may qualify you for good pricing and loan amount in your future loan disbursement. When you make a partial payment, we will first use it to pay any arrears or overdue interest and then apply the payment to reduce the agreement term.

6.5. Loan Extension
The Borrower agrees to repay the entire loan amount no later than the Loan Maturity Date specified in the Loan Agreement. Where the Borrower cannot meet the obligation to repay the Loan before the Loan Maturity Date, the Borrower can apply for a Loan Extension on or before the Loan Maturity Date subject to the following:

The Borrower may opt to apply for a Loan Extension to extend the loan by covering only the accrued interest and where Loan Extension is granted;
CashXpress may consider the full coverage of interest without addressing the loan principal as an application from the Borrower to extend the Borrower’s Loan;
Following the Borrower’s application for Loan Extension, CashXpress has the discretion (but not the obligation) to extend the loan by the same Loan Period in the Loan Agreement;
If the Borrower chooses to cover only Loan Interest and Overdue Interest without the intention to extend the Loan Period, written notification must be sent to info@cashx.ng within a Grace Period of 2 (two) days;
CashXpress will promptly communicate the decision on the Loan Extension application, whether the Loan Extension application has been granted or not, to the Borrower through the provided contact information;
The terms of the Loan Agreement, including interest rates and repayment conditions shall remain applicable during the Loan Extension period.
6.6. Loan Repayment Default
All outstanding loan amounts will become immediately due and payable without extension opportunities if any of the following events occur:

Failure to make timely loan repayments and request an extension before loan expiry.
Breach of loan terms and conditions, including affirmations in the loan agreement.
Filing for bankruptcy.
Detecting fraud or suspicious activity.
Inability to meet financial obligations as defined by Section 1 of the Bankruptcy Law.
Lender’s determination of loan inappropriateness due to specific circumstances.
Non-compliance with any condition or agreement in this document, which remains uncorrected after a 3-day notice.
CashXpress will collect the total amount due on each Loan Maturity Date as outlined in the provided repayment schedule of the Loan Agreement. In the event of non-repayment on the specified Loan Maturity Date, CashXpress will make reasonable attempts to collect the outstanding amount using direct debit tools, like initiating a direct debit from all of the Borrower’s accounts within the following 24 (twenty-four) hours. By utilising our services, you implicitly authorise CashXpress to exercise this right.

After 48 hours of non-payment of the outstanding repayment amount from the repayment date, an additional 3.00% Overdue Interest will accrue daily on the outstanding amount.

Upon default, we may use external Collections Agencies to collect the outstanding amount or initiate legal proceedings without prior notice.

We may terminate these Terms of Use if you engage in fraud or criminal activities or provide misleading information. In such cases, the full loan amount with interest may be demanded.

7. Account Linkage to Bank Card
You may be asked or required to link your bank card to your Account to enable automated Direct Debits. By linking your Account to a bank card, you agree to the following terms regarding automated Direct Debits and potential arrangements for direct debits in the event of loan default:

By binding your Bank Card, you authorise and facilitate Direct Debits for the purpose of loan repayment, where You have chosen direct debit as your repayment plan;
In the event of default on the loan, You acknowledge and agree that, if necessary, Direct Debits may be initiated from Your linked bank account to fulfill outstanding payment obligations. This authorisation covers the outstanding loan amount and any applicable fees or charges;
You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the bank card information provided for linkage. Any linked bank card details changes must be promptly updated on Your Account;
You may revoke the authorisation for automated Direct Debits before the expiration of Your Loan. Revocation of authorisation does not exempt you from meeting existing financial obligations, and alternative repayment methods may be required.
8. Change of Information
The User may at any time and from time to time notify us in writing of a change of any information provided to us at registration, including your address. We may be unable to respond to you if you contact us from an address, telephone number, or email account that is not registered with us.
